## Progress of Project

1) ~~Interact with XBee device and computer~~
2) ~~Develop library on comp side to programmatically interact with XBee~~
3) ~~Develop temporary CLI program that will interact with XBee~~
4) ~~Establish protocol between host xbee and remote xbees~~
5) ~~Develop firmware for Remote XBee devices~~
6) ~~Establish working full-duplex communication between host and remote devices~~
7) ~~Attach sensors to remote devices to test actual data communication~~
7.5) Create standalone box that holds a single module with LCD for debugging
8) Test communication at a distance of remotes and master while using vanilla wire-antenna
9) Research different types of antennas that will be best case for this project
10) Find suitable places in Texas that will allow for different environment testing of devices
11) Test communication at a distance (much farther), using possible antenna candidates.
12) Decide on solar panel/charger/battery combo for this project
13) Create prototype module(s) (Deer feeder, etc..) that can be controlled from > 1 mile
14) Test communication with module(s) based on distance, weather, obstacles
15) Research on delivery method for end-product (what does the user use to interact with devices)
16) Replacing CLI host software to UI prototype
17)
